# DM Cheat Sheet – Overlord: Ashes of the New World

## Quick Reference Tables

### Encounter Timers (roll or choose)
| Roll | Timer Type | Ticks |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1    | Civilians at risk | 3 ticks |
| 2    | Ritual completes | 4 ticks |
| 3    | Reinforcements arrive | 3 ticks |
| 4    | Environment escalates (fire/flood/ice) | 4 ticks |
| 5    | Intel window closes | 2 ticks |
| 6    | Enemy extraction | 3 ticks |

**How to Use**: Advance 1 tick/round or when PCs miss a beat; clever play can subtract ticks.

### Audit Complications (on 1–2 when using Nazarick-flagged resources)
1. **Inspection**: Time tax, confiscation risk, or escort demand
2. **Adjustment**: Enemy counters a known tactic
3. **Favor**: A "gift" arrives with strings
4. **Shadow**: A witness misreads events; rumor fallout
5. **Scar**: Small area hexed by residual magic
6. **Double-Bind**: Two good options, both with costs

### Parley Token Effects (each side has 2 per scene)
| Token | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Safe Word** | Pause hostilities; next check with advantage if you concede one point |
| **Concession** | Lower DC by 2; grant the other side one narrative tag they can invoke later |
| **Escalate** | Raise DC by 2; add a threat (timer +1 tick) but gain leverage on success |
| **Walk Away** | End parley on your terms; opponent gets +1 forward in next encounter |

## Faction Meter Effects
| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **2 Access** | Audiences, markets, escorts |
| **3 Leverage** | Call in aid; cancel a hunt; safe route |
| **4 Control** | Compel concessions; rewrite minor rules |
| **5 Ownership** | Define outcomes; attached strings bite later |

## Scene Starters (Hooks)
- "The bell tolls under water; names unlock passage."
- "A ledger weighs mercies—yours are tallied."
- "A lighthouse forces beasts to talk first."
- "Audit milepost ahead; your papers are … creative."

## Boss Beat Template (3 Phases)
1. **Beat 1**: Establish pillar (control/burst/zone)
2. **Beat 2**: Terrain changes (lair focus toggled; timer pressure)
3. **Beat 3**: Offer bargain or unleash mythic phase

## Lair Focus Ideas
- **Focus Candles**: Extinguish 3 to suppress one lair action for 1 minute
- **Choir Keystone**: Break to invert an anti-magic aura
- **Crown Rod**: De-tune to weaken lattice buffs

## Quiet Mile Boons
- −2 to stealth/social DCs; divination fails
- Rumors carry: +1 info on Gather Information

## Downtime Prompts
1. Which tie do you deepen, and what did it cost?
2. What rumor do you seed, and whom does it inconvenience?
3. Which principle do you risk, and what would prove you wrong?

## Fast Consequence Grid
| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Success/Clean** | clock −1, boon, faint ping |
| **Success/Messy** | clock −1, complication |
| **Fail/Forward** | intel gained, clock +1 |
| **Fail/Hard** | timer +1, faction −1, injury/gear cost |

## Important Notes
- **Tone Dials**: Keep visible: `Grim Audit` • `Gray Chessboard` • `Heroic Resistance`
- **Scene Structure**: Tie every scene to one faction meter and one personal cost.
