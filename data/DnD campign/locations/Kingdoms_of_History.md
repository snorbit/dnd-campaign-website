# Kingdoms of History

Two ancient superpowers that shaped the history of the world, defined by the legacy of the Warbound General, Zachery Tokisaki.

## 1. The Kingdom of Hate (Formerly The Hate Dominion)

**"Strength born of sorrow, power born of hate."**

* **Status**: Legendary Superpower (Historically) / Militaristic Empire (Current)
* **Capital**: **Ironheart**
* **Ruler**: Currently ruled by a council of Warlords trying to live up to the legend (or perhaps a puppet king).
* **History**:
    *   Two centuries ago, the Kingdom of Hate was considered a minor nation until the rise of **General Zachery Tokisaki**.
    *   Under Zachery's command, the kingdom's armies became invincible. They conquered 70% of the known continent in a campaign known as "The Era of Iron".
    *   The kingdom is known throughout history solely because of Zachery. His tactical genius and raw power elevated it to the status of the "Most Powerful Kingdom in History".
    *   After Zachery's sudden disappearance/retirement 200 years ago, the kingdom's expansion halted, but its borders remain vast and heavily fortified.
* **Culture**:
    *   A society that values strength, discipline, and absolute loyalty.
    *   Statues of Zachery (often lacking his face or depicted in full armor) stand in every major city.
    *   They view "Love" as a weakness, iron and blood as truth.

## 2. The Kingdom of Epstein

**"The gilded cage of history."**

* **Status**: Wealthy Merchant Kingdom / Cultural Hub
* **Capital**: **Isle of Pleasures**
* **History**:
    *   The Kingdom of Epstein shares a long, bloodied history with the Kingdom of Hate.
    *   Originally the primary rival to Hate, they survived "The Era of Iron" not by force, but by diplomacy, trade, and perhaps... darker bargains.
    *   It was here that General Zachery eventually "retired" seeking a peaceful life with his wife, Kurumi, hoping to escape his warbound nature.
    *   **The Betrayal**: History whispers that it was agents of Epstein (or perhaps a false flag by Hate extremists) that caused the death of Kurumi, triggering Zachery's final, despair-filled rampage before his "death" and rebirth as an undead.
* **Current Relations**:
    *   An uneasy truce exists between Hate and Epstein. Hate views Epstein as weak and deceitful; Epstein views Hate as a sleeping beast.

## 3. The New Dungeon: The Abyssal Barracks

**"Where the general's victims and soldiers wait forever."**

* **Location**: Deep underground, accessible through a sealed chasm beneath the ruins of Zachery's old estate in the Kingdom of Epstein (or the borderlands).
* **Level Range**: **Tier 4 (Level 17-20+)** - Late Game Challenge.

### Description
A massive underground complex that served as a secret training ground or perhaps a mass grave for the armies of "The Era of Iron". The air is thick with the despair and depression that radiates from Zachery's legacy.

### Features
1.  **The Horde Mechanics**:
    *   **The Meat-Shields**: Hundreds of "Weaker Enemies" (Skeleton Warriors, Zombies, minor Demons) swarm constantly. They are Minions (1 HP but high damage) or just standard CR 5-8 undead in groups of 20+.
    *   **Objective**: Players must carve paths through literal walls of bodies. AoE spells are essential.

2.  **The Elites (Powerful Enemies)**:
    *   **Death Knights of the Old Guard**: Zachery's former lieutenants raised as CR 17 Death Knights.
    *   **Despair Giants**: Massive constructs made of rusted armor and sadness.
    *   **Loot Goblins (Mythic)**: Rare enemies carrying the "Good Loot" mentioned.

3.  **The Loot**:
    *   Contains hoards of gold, gems, and magic items lost during the conquests.
    *   **Unique Items**: Weapons that feed on kill counts, armor that screams when hit.

4.  **The Atmosphere**:
    *   As Zachery grows more depressed/despairing without Kurumi, the dungeon grows darker and more dangerous, physically manifesting his mental state.
