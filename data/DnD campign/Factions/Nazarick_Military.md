# Nazarick Military Hierarchy & Summons

## Overview
Nazarick's strength lies not just in its Guardians, but in its inexhaustible armies. These forces are divided into "Pop Monsters" (automatically respawning low-tier guards) and "Mercenary Summons" (paid for with YGGDRASIL gold/data).

---

## The Low Echelon ("Pop" Monsters)
*Expendable. Infinite. Fearless.*
Used for basic security, labor, and swarming tactics.

### 1. Skeleton Warriors / Zombies (CR 1/4)
- **Role**: Fodder. They clog hallways and trigger traps so better units don't have to.
- **Gear**: Rusted scraps.
- **Tactics**: Grapple and shove.

### 2. Elder Liches (CR 5)
- **Role**: Unit Commanders / Magic Artillery.
- **Use**: They organize the mindless undead.
- **Spells**: *Fireball, Fly, Counterspell*.
- **Note**: These serve as basic bureaucrats in the Sorcerer Kingdom's administration.

### 3. Death Knights (CR 5 - Defensive Variant)
*Modified Stats: AC 20, HP 100*
- **Role**: Heavy Infantry / Riot Control.
- **Trait: Die Hard**: When reduced to 0 HP, they drop to 1 HP instead (once per long rest).
- **Tactics**: They use "Taunt" mechanic (Compelled Duel) to draw fire from squishy casters.

## The Mid Echelon (Mercenary Summons)
*Specialized. Dangerous. Expense required.*

### 1. Soul Eaters (CR 8)
- **Role**: Cavalry / Terror Weapons.
- **Appearance**: Floating skeletal horses wreathed in mist.
- **Aura**: *Soul Drain*. Any creature starting its turn within 10ft takes Necrotic damage. If killed by this, their soul is eaten (no Revivify).

### 2. Shadow Demons (CR 4)
- **Role**: Spies / Scouts.
- **Skill**: +10 Stealth. Can move through walls.
- **Use**: Often attached to the Pleiades as forward observers.

### 3. Hanzos (CR 10)
- **Role**: Ninja / Assassin.
- **Trait**: *Invisibility* at will.
- **Tactics**: Target enemy commanders. They prefer to strike from the ceiling.

*The Honor Guard. Only mobilized for war.*

### 1. Eight-Edge Assassins (CR 12)

## The Sorcerer King's Personal Summons
