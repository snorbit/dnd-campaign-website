# The Pleiades Six Stars: Tactical Audit Unit

## Overview
The **Pleiades Six Stars** are the final defense line of Nazarick and a specialized "Audit Unit" deployed when Sebas Tian's loyalty is in question—or when he requires a support squad that can level a city district.

**Encounter Design**: This is a **Council Fight**. The maids work as a cohesive unit. Killing one breaks their synergy but enrages the others.
**Context**: Typically encountered *with* Sebas (if he is loyal/testing the party) or *against* Sebas (if the party is defending him from a purge).

## Shared Trait: "Formation: Six Stars"
As long as **3 or more** Pleiades are conscious within 60 feet of each other, they share the following benefits:
- **Shared Vision**: They cannot be surprised and share all sensory information.
- **Damage Mitigation**: If a Pleiades member takes damage, an adjacent member can use a Reaction to take half the damage instead.
- **Morale**: They are immune to Charmed and Frightened conditions.

## Synergy Actions (Lair Actions)
On Initiative Count 20 (losing ties), the squad executes a synchronized maneuver:

1.  **"Protect High Command"**: Yuri and Solution move up to their speed to shield Narberal or Lupusregina.
2.  **"Crossfire Delta"**: CZ creates a "kill zone." Anyone moving through it takes fire damage from Narberal's suppression.
3.  **"The Audit Ends"**: If Sebas is present and allied, all Pleiades grant him Advantage on his next attack. If Sebas is the enemy, they all gain Advantage on attacks against him.

## Roleplaying the Encounter
- **Lupusregina** laughs at critical hits (received or dealt).
- **Narberal** constantly insults the party ("Worthless maggots").
- **Yuri** politely corrects their combat stance before punching them.
- **Sebas (if present)**: Sighs. "I taught them too well."
