# Session 1 Maps — Fog Overlay & Slides Upload Guide

## What you’ll have after running the download script
- Folder: `Session1_Maps/`
  - Subfolders for each scene (01–10)
  - Each subfolder contains the gridded map image
  - `Assets/` folder for overlays and tokens

---

## Step 1: Create a universal fog overlay
### Option A: Use PowerPoint (fast)
1. Open PowerPoint
2. Insert a new slide (blank)
3. Insert → Shapes → Rectangle
4. Cover the entire slide with black rectangles
5. Group all rectangles (Ctrl+G)
6. Right-click → Save as Picture → PNG
7. Save as `Session1_Maps\Assets\fog_overlay.png`

### Option B: Use any image editor
- Create a black PNG the same size as your maps (e.g., 1920x1080)
- Save as `Session1_Maps\Assets\fog_overlay.png`

## Step 2: Create Google Slides deck

### Create the presentation
1. Open Google Slides
2. New presentation → Title: “Session 1 Maps”
3. Share → View-only link → send to players

### Add each map slide
For each scene (01–10):
1. New slide
2. Background → Choose image → Upload
3. Select the map from its folder
4. Add a title at the top (so you can jump scenes):
   - 01 Ruined Village / Square
   - 02 Shop (Hawthorn & Wick)
   - 03 Blacksmith / Forge
   - 04 Chapel / Temple
   - 05 Forest Path / Clearing
   - 06 River Crossing / Ambush
   - 07 Totem Maze / Standing Stones
   - 08 Cave Entrance / Lair
   - 09 Ritual Chamber / Dome
   - 10 Machinery / Audit Room

---

## Step 3: Add fog overlay to each slide
1. Insert → Image → Upload `fog_overlay.png`
2. Resize to cover the map
3. Send to back (so it’s under tokens but over the map)
4. When players explore, select the overlay → delete parts to reveal

### Pro tip
- Duplicate each slide before combat so you have a clean version
- Keep a “tokens” slide at the end with player/NPC icons

---

## Step 4: Add tokens (optional)
1. Create a new slide at the end: “Tokens”
2. Add simple shapes or images for:
   - PCs (different colors/shapes)
   - NPCs (e.g., Red Eye, Elara)
   - Enemies (goblins, worg)
3. Copy-paste onto map slides as needed

---

## Step 5: Play!
- You edit; players view
- Move tokens on top of the background
- Delete fog as they explore
- Jump between slides using titles or slide numbers

## Want me to make a ready-to-upload ZIP?
If you’d rather have:
- All maps pre-downloaded
- Fog overlay PNG included
- Token sheet included
- Folder structure ready

Just say **“Build the full ZIP”** and I’ll prep the files.
