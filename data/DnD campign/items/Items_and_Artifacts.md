An ornate standing mirror with a frame of intertwined silver and onyx.

  - You can see normally in heavy rain and strong winds.
- **Lightning Rod**: When you are hit by a ranged attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can immediately make a ranged spell attack against the attacker, dealing 2d10 lightning damage on a hit.

### Drawback
While attuned to this rod, you have vulnerability to cold damage, as the storm's power within you makes you more susceptible to its opposite.

### Lore
Forged in the heart of a thunderstorm by a cabal of storm sorcerers, the Stormcaller's Conduit is said to contain a fragment of the Storm Lord's power. The rod is warm to the touch and occasionally emits small arcs of electricity, especially when a storm is near.

### Drawback
Each time you use a Blightbloom Seed, roll a d20. On a 1, the seed's necrotic energy backlashes, dealing 2d6 necrotic damage to you.

### Lore
Created by a circle of druids who sought to fight fire with fire against a spreading blight, these seeds contain the essence of corrupted nature. While powerful, their use is considered taboo by most druidic orders, as they represent a perversion of the natural order.

---

## 27. Duskcrown
*Legendary, wondrous item, requires attunement*  
A delicate circlet of blackened silver set with a single, ever-shifting gem that seems to contain a swirling vortex of twilight.

### Properties

While this effect is active, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- **Eclipse's Embrace (1/week)**: As an action, you can create a 30-foot radius sphere of magical darkness centered on yourself. The darkness spreads around corners and is unaffected by nonmagical light, and creatures with darkvision can't see through it. The darkness lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). While this effect is active, you can see through the darkness as if it were dim light.

### Curse
While attuned to the Duskcrown, you become vulnerable to radiant damage, and you find it increasingly difficult to tolerate bright light. After each long rest, you must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion when you end your turn in bright light. This exhaustion can only be removed by completing a long rest in complete darkness.

### Lore
Forged in the dying light of a forgotten eclipse, the Duskcrown is said to contain a fragment of the moment when day becomes night. Its creator's identity has been lost to time, but legends speak of a queen who sought to extend the twilight hour indefinitely, only to be consumed by the very shadows she sought to command. The crown's power is immense, but so too is its hunger for the light—both literal and metaphorical.

- **Searing Strike (1/day)**: As an action, make a melee attack with the gauntlets. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and catches fire, taking 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to extinguish the flames.

### Drawback
While attuned to these gauntlets, you have vulnerability to cold damage.

### Lore
Forged in the heart of an active volcano by a reclusive fire giant smith, the Emberheart Gauntlets are said to contain a sliver of the Elemental Plane of Fire.

### Curse
While attuned to this cloak, you find it increasingly difficult to remain in bright light. After each long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion if you start your turn in bright light. This exhaustion can only be removed by completing a long rest in complete darkness.

### Lore
Woven from the fabric of the Far Realm, the Voidwalker's Cloak is said to have been created by a cult that worshipped the entities that dwell in the spaces between dimensions. The cloak is cold to the touch and seems to ripple and shift even when there is no wind, as if it exists partially in another plane.

The axe hums with energy, and its blade is warm to the touch, occasionally emitting small arcs of electricity, especially when a storm is near. The weapon is highly sought after by warriors who wish to harness the raw power of the storm in battle.

---

## 32. Phoenix Down Pendant
*Rare, requires attunement*  
A delicate silver chain with a single, glowing red feather encased in crystal.

### Properties

### Lore
The Bloodthorn Vine Whip is a living weapon, grown from a rare and dangerous plant that feeds on blood. The vine is warm to the touch and pulses rhythmically, as if it has a heartbeat of its own. The whip is sentient, though not in a way that allows for communication—instead, it expresses its desires through subtle movements and the occasional, almost imperceptible tightening around its wielder's wrist. The vine requires regular feeding, and if denied fresh blood, it will begin to feed on its wielder.

While attuned to the Celestial Halo, you have vulnerability to necrotic damage, and you radiate an aura of divine energy that makes it impossible for you to hide or go unnoticed by undead and fiends within 300 feet.

### Lore
Forged from the essence of a fallen angel's wings, the Celestial Halo is a symbol of divine favor and purity. The halo emits a soft, golden light that is warm to the touch and fills those nearby with a sense of peace and hope. The halo is sentient, though it communicates only through emotions and visions, and it seeks to guide its wearer toward acts of great heroism and self-sacrifice. The halo cannot be worn by those who are not pure of heart, and any attempt to do so results in a searing pain that cannot be ignored.

## 37. Dwarven Runehammer
*Very rare, requires attunement by a dwarf*  
A massive warhammer covered in glowing runes that pulse with power.

### Properties
- **Rune of the Forge**: This magic warhammer has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls. It deals an additional 1d8 fire damage on a hit.
- **Rune of Warding (3 charges)**: As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can expend 1 charge to grant yourself a +3 bonus to AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The hammer regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
- **Rune of the Mountain (1/day)**: As an action, you can strike the ground with the hammer, causing a shockwave in a 20-foot radius. Each creature of your choice in that area must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and take 3d8 thunder damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
- **Rune of the Ancestors (1/week)**: As an action, you can call upon the spirits of your ancestors to aid you in battle. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
  - You have advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws.
  - Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d8 force damage.
  - You have resistance to all damage except psychic damage.

### Drawback
While attuned to this weapon, you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, as the runes on the hammer emit a faint humming sound that can be heard within 30 feet.

### Lore
Forged by the master runesmiths of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Khazad-dûm, the Dwarven Runehammer is a weapon of legend. The hammer is covered in glowing runes that tell the story of the dwarven people, from their creation by the All-Father to their greatest triumphs and tragedies. The hammer is warm to the touch, and those who hold it can sometimes hear the distant sound of hammers on anvils and the deep, resonant chanting of dwarven runesongs. The hammer is sentient, though it communicates only with its wielder, offering cryptic advice and warnings in the form of dreams and visions.

## 38. Lich's Phylactery
*Legendary, requires attunement by a spellcaster*  
A small, ornate box made of blackened bone and inscribed with necromantic runes.

### Properties
- **Soul Binding**: When you die while attuned to this item, your soul is drawn into the phylactery instead of passing on. While your soul is in the phylactery, you are aware of your surroundings as if you were in the space the phylactery occupies, but you cannot take any actions or be affected by any spells or effects, except for those that affect undead or the soul.
- **Necrotic Surge (3/day)**: As a bonus action, you can draw upon the necrotic energy stored within the phylactery to empower your spells. The next spell you cast that deals necrotic damage deals an additional 2d10 necrotic damage.
- **Lich's Curse (1/day)**: As an action, you can curse a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 necrotic damage and be cursed for 1 minute. While cursed in this way, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws, and any healing it receives is reduced by half.
- **Soul Harvest (1/week)**: As an action, you can consume the soul of a humanoid that has died within the past minute. The creature's soul is trapped in the phylactery, and the creature can only be restored to life by a wish spell. When you use this ability, you regain hit points equal to the creature's hit point maximum.

### Curse
While attuned to the phylactery, you are considered undead for the purposes of spells and effects. Additionally, you must consume the soul of a humanoid at least once per month, or you begin to wither and decay. For each week that passes without consuming a soul, you gain one level of exhaustion that cannot be removed by any means short of a wish spell or divine intervention. If you die while your soul is in the phylactery, your body reforms within 1d10 days within 5 feet of the phylactery, unless the phylactery is destroyed. If the phylactery is destroyed while your soul is inside, you die permanently.

### Lore
Created by the archlich Vecna as a means of achieving immortality, the Lich's Phylactery is one of the most feared and sought-after artifacts in the multiverse. The phylactery is a small, ornate box made of blackened bone and inscribed with necromantic runes that pulse with a sickly green light. The box is warm to the touch, and those who hold it often report hearing faint, whispering voices that seem to come from within. The phylactery is sentient, and it hungers for the souls of the living, constantly urging its wielder to feed it. The phylactery is also highly intelligent and possesses a vast knowledge of necromancy, though it shares its secrets only when it serves its own inscrutable purposes.

## 39. Phoenix Feather Quill
*Uncommon, wondrous item*  
A quill made from a single, glowing red-gold feather that never runs out of ink.

- **Scribe's Boon**: You can copy spells into your spellbook in half the normal time and cost.
- **Flame Script (1/day)**: Write a message that only the intended recipient can read. The message burns away after being read.

### Drawback
If the quill is used to write a lie, it bursts into harmless flames, destroying the false document.

### Lore
Crafted from a single feather of a phoenix, this quill is said to contain a spark of the legendary bird's fiery essence. The quill is warm to the touch and glows faintly in the dark, its light pulsing gently like the embers of a dying fire. The quill is highly sought after by scholars and scribes, not only for its practical uses but also for the beauty of the script it produces—each stroke seems to shimmer with an inner light, as if the words themselves are alive with magic.

A dagger with a blade of enchanted ice that never melts.

### Properties

- **Icy Burst (3/day)**: As a bonus action, you can cause the blade to erupt in a burst of freezing cold.

- **Winter's Grasp**: While attuned to this weapon, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection.

### Drawback
While attuned to this weapon, you have vulnerability to fire damage.

### Lore
Forged in the frozen wastes of the North by the frost giants, the Frostforged Dagger is a weapon of exquisite craftsmanship. The blade is made from enchanted ice that never melts, and it emits a faint, misty vapor in warm environments. The hilt is wrapped in the hide of a yeti, providing a secure grip even in the harshest conditions. The dagger is cold to the touch, and those who wield it for extended periods often find that their breath becomes visible even in warm rooms.

---

## 41. Shadowstep Boots
*Rare, requires attunement*  
These sleek, black leather boots seem to absorb the light around them.

### Properties
- **Shadow Stride**: While in dim light or darkness, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- **Step Through Shadows (3/day)**: As a bonus action, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
- **Umbral Sight**: You can see in magical and nonmagical darkness up to 60 feet.

### Drawback
While attuned to these boots, you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects that deal radiant damage.

### Lore
Crafted by a secretive order of shadow monks, these boots are said to be woven from the very essence of the Shadowfell.

Those who wear the boots often report hearing faint whispers in the darkness, though the source of these voices remains a mystery.

## 42. Bloodthorn Vine Whip
*Rare, weapon (whip), requires attunement*  
A living whip made from a bloodthorn vine that pulses with a dark, crimson glow.

### Properties
- **Bloodthirsty Strike**: When you hit a creature with this magic whip, you can choose to deal an additional 1d6 necrotic damage. If you do, you regain hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
- **Grasping Vine (3/day)**: As a bonus action, you can cause the whip to grow thorns. For 1 minute, the whip's reach increases by 10 feet, and it gains the finesse property.
- **Vine Lash (1/day)**: As an action, you can make a melee attack against each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

### Drawback
Each time you use the whip's Bloodthirsty Strike, you must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion due to the drain on your life force.

### Lore
The Bloodthorn Vine Whip is a living weapon, grown from a rare and dangerous plant that feeds on blood. The vine is warm to the touch and pulses rhythmically, as if it has a heartbeat of its own. The whip is sentient, though not in a way that allows for communication—instead, it expresses its desires through subtle movements and the occasional, almost imperceptible tightening around its wielder's wrist. The vine requires regular feeding, and if denied fresh blood, it will begin to feed on its wielder.

A radiant, floating ring of golden light that hovers above the head of its wearer.

- **Divine Intervention (1/week)**: As an action, you can call upon the power of the heavens to cast the heal spell (no components required).

### Drawback
While attuned to the Celestial Halo, you have vulnerability to necrotic damage, and you radiate an aura of divine energy that makes it impossible for you to hide or go unnoticed by undead and fiends within 300 feet.
