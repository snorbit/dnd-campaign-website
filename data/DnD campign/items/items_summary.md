Items Summary (from items.json)

Overview
- Format: id, name, rarity, description, effects[]
- Count: 40+ artifacts numbered; rarities vary (Uncommon/Rare/Legendary at key breakpoints: 10, 20, 30, 40).
- Theme: Nazarick-origin tools with primary/secondary effects suitable for plot hooks and faction leverage.

Usage
- Map numbered artifacts to narrative roles (audit tools, mercy gear, parley tokens).
- Tie activation or attunement to faction meters when appropriate (e.g., Nazarick 2+ unlocks full features).
- Add narrative tags to influence reactions: [Nazarick], [Choir], [Syndicate].

Example Entries (condensed)
- ID 1: Overlord Artifact 1 (Uncommon) – Nazarick‑adjacent trinket; simple boon + utility.
- ID 10: Overlord Artifact 10 (Legendary) – Significant parley leverage; risk of being tracked.
- ID 20: Overlord Artifact 20 (Legendary) – Crown Road lattice interaction; powerful but costly.
- ID 30: Overlord Artifact 30 (Legendary) – Battlefield rewrite potential; limited charges.
- ID 40: Overlord Artifact 40 (Legendary) – Campaign‑level effect; mythic constraints.

Conversion Notes
- See Items_and_Artifacts.txt for richly flavored counterparts and drawbacks.
- When importing into 5e stat blocks, keep attunement costs, actions, and drawbacks explicit.
