## Downtime Prompts (Give to Players)

## Player Handout: Lattice Brief (Plain Language)
> The Crown Road is part of a giant measuring ritual. Stopping it saves people now but weakens tomorrow. Letting it run costs now but may save many later—under someone's terms. You will choose.

## Parley Tokens
- Use colored beads or cards marked: "Safe Word," "Concession," "Escalate," "Walk Away."
- Each parley scene, each side gets 2 tokens; spending one changes the scene's rules for a beat.
