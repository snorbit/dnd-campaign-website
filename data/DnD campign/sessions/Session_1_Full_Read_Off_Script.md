# SESSION 1: THE OAKHAVEN AUDIT - COMPLETE READ-OFF SCRIPT

> **DM GUIDE**: This is your complete script for Session 1. Read the "Read Aloud" sections verbatim to your players. Runtime will vary (commonly 2.5–4.5 hours) depending on how much the table roleplays in town and how long combat runs. Take your time - atmosphere is everything.

---

## COLD OPEN: THE AUDIT INITIATES

**Read Aloud**:
"A sound like an abacus made of bones. A slow, deliberate clicking—counting something you don't understand. Somewhere far away, a voice speaks with perfect calm, as if reading a shopping list.

'Specimen viability: acceptable.'

The words are not spoken in any language you know, yet your mind translates them anyway.

'Area designation: Oakhaven. Ledger state: unbalanced.'

You feel—just for a heartbeat—like you are not a person. Like you are a number written on paper. Like something is looking through you, not at you.

Then the voice adds one final line, almost bored:

'Commencing Audit.'

The clicking stops.

And you wake up."

## PLAYER INTRODUCTIONS (Before Session Start)

**DM**: "Welcome to Overlord: Ashes of the New World. Before we begin, let's introduce your characters:"

**TROY**: "You are a hill dwarf fighter, a blacksmith whose village was destroyed. You wander aimlessly, friendly but willing to kill if told to. You're not the smartest, but you're incredibly strong and tough."

**ZACHERY**: "You are an undead paladin, formerly the greatest General of the Kingdom of Hate. After finding your wife Kurumi dead, you died fighting Ainz and revived as undead fueled by love and hate. You care about nothing and no one except Kurumi."

**GUTS**: "You are a human fighter, a mercenary born from a corpse, seeking revenge against demons and Griffith. You're super-humanly strong and determined, loyal to your companions but haunted by severe trauma."

**CALILAC**: "You are a wood elf druid, Princess of the Mantis Kingdom. You're kind and loving, caring for people, animals, and plants. You despise anyone named Sam - that was your father's name who abandoned you and your kingdom."

**WIMBIE**: "You are a rock gnome artificer, Zachery's pet gnome. You're super-intelligent but impulsive, committing war crimes almost daily. You follow Zachery everywhere and have a micro-transaction blade that converts gold to damage."

# ACT 1: THE OAKHAVEN AFTERMATH (90 Minutes)

## THE AWAKENING

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"Your room feels smaller than it should. Dust hangs in the air like gray fog, catching the weak light in slow, drifting sheets. Something has rattled every shelf—splinters of pottery, a cracked cup, a knife on the floor pointing at the door like an omen. Outside, the village doesn’t sound asleep. It sounds *absent*. No birds. No wind in the eaves. Just a distant, irregular creak of timber settling and the faint pop of embers where a home is still burning." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The world you wake up to is not the one you knew. The morning air in Oakhaven is usually a symphony of life: the distant, rhythmic thumping of the grain-mill, the sharp, metallic clinking of Garrick's forge, and the muffled shouting of farmhands heading to the fields. Today, that symphony has been silenced. 

The silence is physical. It's a heavy, damp weight that sits on your chest as you open your eyes. The light filtering through your window—if your home still has a window—is a bruised, necrotic purple, filtered through a high-altitude mist that shouldn't exist in late summer. As you step out into the street, the first thing you notice is the smell. It isn't just woodsmoke; it's the acrid, chemical sting of something burned at an impossible temperature. It's the smell of wet ash, spilled oil, and the sharp, copper tang of blood that hasn't yet dried in the mud. 

Oakhaven, the jewel of the valley, has been hollowed out. TIMELINE START."

## THE RADIATING DESPAIR

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"Oakhaven looks like a painting that was scraped with a knife. Roofs have collapsed into jagged ribs. Patches of ground are blackened in perfect circles, as if fire kissed the earth and left without spreading. Here and there, a fence has been cut clean through—no splintering, no tear—just a line like a surgeon’s incision. You spot strange marks in the soot: thin parallel scratches, too uniform to be claws, too precise to be tools." 

**Read Aloud**:
"You move toward the village square. Every step feels like walking through glue. The survivors are emerging from the wreckage like ghosts. Here is Old Man Miller, his beard singed to the chin, clutching a single wooden spoon. Here is little Ben, sitting on a pile of rubble that used to be his father's stable, staring at a dead horse with wide, unblinking eyes. 

The village square is a mess of spilled trade goods and shattered pottery. The central well, usually a place of gossip and laughter, is now surrounded by the wounded. They aren't crying. They are in shock, their eyes reflecting the gray sky. You see the tracks now—thousands of them. Perfect, geometric bootprints that form a corridor of invasion from the North Gate to the Mayor's residence."

### MICRO-EVENT: THE CRYING WIDOW

**Read Aloud**:
"A woman named Martha collapses at your feet. She's clutching a shredded piece of black silk. 'They didn't even fight back,' she sobs, her voice cracking the silence. 'The guards... they just stood there. Like they were made of stone. The dark ones walked right past them, pointed a blue light at my husband, and he walked with them. He didn't even look back. He just... marched.'"

## MAYOR ELDRIN'S ORATION

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The well is ringed with the wounded and the numb. Someone has draped a torn sailcloth over the stones to make a triage tarp, but it sags with rainwater and ash. Buckets stand half-full of gray slurry instead of clean water. Every few breaths, the wind shifts and you catch that metallic tang again—blood in the mud, blood on hands, blood in the cracks of the cobbles." 

**Read Aloud**:
"Mayor Eldrin is standing on the stone rim of the well. His velvet coat, once the pride of the village, is a tattered rag, agora-gray with soot. He is ringing a handbell, but it sounds tinny, a pathetic chime against the vast, predatory silence of the woods. 

'GATHER ROUND!' he shouts, and the survivors flinch at the volume. 'Listen to me! We are not dead! The Audit has taken our blood, it has taken our kin, and it has taken our hope—but it has not taken our memory! We saw them. We saw the Ruby Eye! We saw the Black Iron!'"

### INTERACTION: MAYOR ELDRIN

**DM**: If players ask about "The Audit": "That's what they called it. The leader—unmoved, robotic—he held a scroll of glowing paper. He stood in my hall and said Oakhaven was 'over-leveraged' in its biological assets. He said he was here to 'balance the ledger'. Then he took Elara. My girl. Garrick's pride. They took everyone who could work, every child with healthy eyes. They left the old and the broken to rot."

**DM**: If players ask about "Nazarick": "The word was on the token they left. A name from a nightmare. A place that shouldn't exist. They said the 'Master of the Tomb' requires data. We are just specimens in a jar to them."

### QUEST HOOK (Random): REVIEW THE LEDGER
**DM**: If the party asks what “The Audit” *means*, Eldrin can add:
"If it's a ledger… then someone somewhere is keeping books. And books can be corrected. Find where they write these numbers. Find the Black Scriptorium. Someone cooked the books on us."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: Review the Ledger
- **Hook**: "Death keeps strict accounts. Someone cooked the books."
- **Objective**: Track down where the Audit records are being made and steal or destroy the ledger pages.
- **Reward (Later)**: A lead to an archive of Audit records that can be used for blackmail, proof, or paid bounties.

## OPTIONAL: PAID WORK IN OAKHAVEN (Quick Gold)

**DM**: If the players want to buy gear or supplies, offer any of these quick jobs. They’re designed to take 5–20 minutes each.

### PAID JOB 1: THE MAYOR’S STRONGBOX (15 gp)
**DM**: Eldrin says:
"My strongbox was under the floor of my hall. Coins for winter taxes… and my seal. If scavengers get it, the valley will think we’re finished. Bring it back, and I’ll pay what I can." 

**DM**: DC 13 Investigation in the Mayor’s wrecked residence to find it.

### PAID JOB 2: SCAVENGERS AT THE SOUTH FENCE (10 gp)
**DM**: A survivor whispers:
"Rats with knives came in after the raiders left. They’re picking bodies and stealing boots. Run them off. Please." 

**DM**: Use 2 bandits (or 3 if party is strong). They flee at half HP.

### PAID JOB 3: RECOVER THE CHAPEL DONATIONS (20 gp)
**DM**: Mother Mathilda says:
"The donation coffer is gone. It’s not just money—it's food, medicine, winter oil. If it’s still here… we need it." 

**DM**: DC 12 Survival to follow drag marks to a nearby shed.

## THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION

### THE GRANARY

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The granary was built to smell like harvest—dry grain, warm straw, old wood. Now it smells like glass and scorched metal. The doors hang crooked on their hinges, their iron bands warped. The stone foundation is slick to the touch, not wet, but strangely *cold*, as if the heat was stolen out of it and carried away." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The Granary is a skeletal ruin. The blue heat still radiates from the stones. Investigating the wreckage, you find something impossible. A basket of eggs, sitting five feet from a pillar that was melted into slag, is completely untouched. Not even cracked. The destruction was targeted with surgical precision."

**DM**: DC 15 Investigation reveals: "You find a 'Thermal Residue' patch. The wood wasn't burned by fire; it was vibrated until it spontaneously combusted. This is high-tier magic disguised as technology."

### THE BAKERY

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The bakery’s windows are blown out, and flour has drifted into every corner like fresh snow. It clings to footprints, to broken loaves, to the shape of a body that was dragged across the floor. The ovens are cold, but the stones around them are stained with a faint bluish sheen, like heat burned the *color* out of the air." 

**Read Aloud**:
"Lila is at the bakery. She hasn't moved for hours. She's staring at the flour-covered floor. You see it too—a message written in the white powder, written in a hand so perfect it looks printed: 'SPECIMEN COLLECTION COMPLETE. AREA A2-B4: DEPLETED.' 

Lila looks up at you. 'They took Thomas because he was 'strong enough for the winch'. That's what they said. He wasn't a man to them. He was a motor. PLEASE. Find the Iron Lair. Find my Thomas.'"

### QUEST HOOK (Random): GUIDE THE LOST
**DM**: Lila also mentions, through tears:
"Before the raid… a patrol went into the woods and never came back. The last thing we heard was screaming and a bell-like sound. If you find them… bring them home."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: Guide the Dead / Guide the Lost
- **Hook**: "They are lost in the mist. Be their lighthouse."
- **Objective**: Find the missing patrol in the Whispering Woods and bring back proof of their fate (or survivors).
- **Reward**: 10 gp for proof, 20 gp per survivor returned alive (paid by Eldrin or pooled by the villagers).

## GEARING FOR THE VOID

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"As you gather what you can, you realize how quickly a village becomes a battlefield. A length of rope is suddenly priceless. A lantern is a lifeline. A clean bandage is as valuable as gold. People watch you pack, not with greed—just with that hollow, animal hope that someone else can do the thing they can’t." 

### THE SHOP: HAWTHORN & WICK (If It’s Still Standing)

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"A half-collapsed storefront near the square still has a sign swinging from one chain: HAWTHORN & WICK. The paint is bubbled from heat and the letters are smeared by soot, but the name is still readable—stubbornly so. The front windows are spiderwebbed with cracks, and someone has nailed boards across the worst of it from the inside. Every few breaths, the wind pushes the loose sign and it taps the wall like a quiet metronome." 
 
**Read Aloud (Entering)**:
"When you step inside, the smell hits first—spilled lamp oil, damp cloth, old paper, and that sharp coppery bite of smoke that clings to everything after a fire. The floorboards creak under scattered glass and seed-like pellets of melted resin. A counter runs along the far wall, and behind it, shelves sag with whatever didn’t shatter during the night. Someone has stacked goods in little ‘islands’ on the floor: rope coiled like sleeping snakes, sacks of grain half-open, and a few careful rows of candles laid out like they’re being counted for a funeral." 
 
**Read Aloud (The Shopkeeper)**:
"A person in a soot-stained apron stands behind the counter with a hand already on a club kept under the till. Their eyes are bloodshot from sleeplessness. They don’t relax when they see you—just recalibrate, like they’re deciding whether you’re customers, looters, or the next wave of the raid." 
 
**DM**: Shopkeeper
- **Name**: Willa Hawthorn (or Wick, your choice)
- **Vibe**: Practical, exhausted, alert; hates looters, respects anyone who helps the village.
- **Opener line**: "If you’re here to steal, pick a different corpse. If you’re here to trade… talk fast." 
- **If asked what happened**: "They didn’t ransack. They *picked*. Like they had a list." 
 
**DM**: What the PCs notice (quick sensory beats)
- **Scarcity**: The good stuff is hidden—anything small, useful, and expensive has been moved behind the counter.
- **Fear**: Every time the wind shifts, the shopkeeper glances toward the treeline.
- **Tells**: A faint, rhythmic vibration in a hanging lantern makes the flame quiver (the hum, even here).
 
**DM**: Trading rules (easy, no fuss)
- **Prices**: Normal unless you want scarcity (+25%).
- **Haggling**: A DC 13 Persuasion can reduce one purchase by 10% (once per visit). Intimidation ends the conversation.
- **Barter**: The shopkeeper will trade at full value for practical goods: rope, arrows, oil, healing supplies, usable armor.
 
**DM**: Optional rumor hooks (drop 1 if you want)
- "A black token was left in the square. Folks won’t touch it."
- "Someone heard *counting* from the woods last night. Like a clerk reading numbers."
- "A ‘collector’ came through weeks ago buying ledgers and birth records." 
 
**DM**: The shop has limited stock after the raid.
 
**DM**: For sale (common goods)
- **Rations (1 day)**: 5 sp
- **Waterskin**: 2 sp
- **Torch**: 1 cp
- **Hooded lantern**: 5 gp
- **Oil (flask)**: 1 sp
- **Rope, hempen (50 ft)**: 1 gp
- **Healer’s kit** (few left): 5 gp
- **Potion of healing** (very limited, 1–2 total): 40 gp
- **Arrows (20)**: 1 gp

**DM**: For sale (limited arms/armor)
- **Shield**: 10 gp
- **Light armor**:
  - **Padded armor**: 5 gp — Thick stitched layers; it smells like smoke and old hay, but it’ll stop a blade from biting deep.
  - **Leather armor**: 10 gp — Simple boiled leather with patched straps; someone’s initials are scratched into the inside.
  - **Studded leather (rare)**: 40 gp — A well-made set with tarnished rivets; too nice for this town, which is why it’s kept out of sight.
- **Medium armor**:
  - **Hide armor**: 10 gp — Cured hide reinforced with bone toggles; more hunting gear than soldier kit.
  - **Chain shirt (rare)**: 40 gp — Worn under a coat, quiet enough to move in; links darkened to avoid glare.
  - **Scale mail (rare)**: 40 gp — Mismatched scales sewn into a heavy backing; it rattles softly like a warning.
- **Heavy armor**:
  - **Ring mail (rare)**: 30 gp — Old militia armor; clunky, but it looks like it’s already seen worse than this.
  - **Chain mail (very rare)**: 40 gp — Heavy iron links with a few repairs; the shopkeeper makes you promise you’re using it to protect people.
- **Simple weapons**:
  - **Club**: 1 sp — Rough-cut hardwood, wrapped with cord for grip; the kind of weapon a farmer reaches for when the barn door breaks at night.
  - **Dagger**: 2 gp — Small, utilitarian blades—kitchen knives and belt knives sharpened until the edge looks hungry.
  - **Spear**: 1 gp — Ash-wood shafts with iron heads; balanced for hunting boar, or keeping something too close from getting closer.
  - **Quarterstaff**: 2 sp — Straight, waxed wood, stained dark from years of handling—simple, sturdy, and hard to disarm.
  - **Sling (if you allow)**: 1 sp — Dusty but workable; the shopkeeper insists you test the leather before you pay.
  - **Light crossbow (if you allow)**: 25 gp — Kept behind the counter; the string is fresh, but the stock still smells faintly of smoke.
- **Martial weapons**: 1–2 available total
  - **Longsword**: 15 gp — Not fancy—just well-kept. The edge is clean, the guard is nicked, and the leather on the grip is worn smooth like it’s been prayed over.
  - **Battleaxe**: 10 gp — A woodcutter’s axe head reforged into a weapon; the bite is heavy and honest, with soot still in the steel.
  - **Mace (if you allow)**: 5 gp — Plain iron head, tight haft—made for cracking bone and breaking the confidence of armor.
  - **Warhammer (if you allow)**: 15 gp — Squared steel face and a reinforced haft; ugly, practical, and brutally effective.
  - **Longbow (rare)**: 40 gp — A tall yew bow with a fresh string; the limbs creak softly like an old door when drawn.

### QUICK GEAR TIERS (Bad / Mid / Decent)
 
**DM**: Use this if the party needs quick gear from scavenging, donations, or the blacksmith/chapel. Pick **one set per character** (or 2 sets total for the whole party if you want it harsher).

#### BAD GEAR (Desperate Survivors)
- **Weapon**: Club or dagger or spear (player chooses)
- **Armor**: None, or **padded** / **leather** (if it makes sense for that PC)
- **Supplies**: 5 torches, 1 day of rations, waterskin
- **Medical**: 1 bandage bundle (stabilize one creature once)

#### MID GEAR (Prepared Villagers)
- **Weapon**: Any one martial weapon available locally (longsword, battleaxe, spear, greatsword, longbow)
- **Armor**: **Leather** or **chain shirt** (whichever fits your vibe)
- **Supplies**: 2 days of rations, 50 ft hempen rope, 1 hunter’s trap or 1 set of caltrops
- **Medical**: 1 **potion of healing** (or 1 use of healer’s kit)

#### DECENT GEAR (Garrick + Chapel Pull Strings)
- **Weapon**: One “well-made” weapon (treat as normal weapon, but it’s clearly superior craftsmanship)
- **Armor**: **Chain mail** (or **scale mail**) for one frontliner OR a **shield** for one character
- **Tools**: 1 utility item (choose 1): **alchemist’s fire**, **acid vial**, **holy water**, or **antitoxin**
- **Medical**: 2 **potions of healing** split between the party

**DM**: Garrick’s shield and Mother Mathilda’s Sun-Oil still apply as written below. These tiers are just extra support if you want it.

### THE BLACKSMITH

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"Garrick’s forge is a ruin of tools that no longer feel trustworthy. The anvil has a hairline crack straight through its face, like a scar. Tongs lie where they fell, still dusted with ash. The hearth is dead—no glow, no warmth—only a faint chemical smell, like lightning struck stone and left it sterile." 

**Read Aloud**:
"Garrick is a ghost of a man. He's standing at his anvil, holding a hammer he hasn't swung all night. The forge is ice-cold. 'I was the best smith in the valley,' he whispers. 'But when the one in the black plate walked in, my steel turned to lead in my hands. He didn't even draw a sword. He just... looked at my anvil and it cracked in half. He took Elara because she has 'pioneer potential'.'"

#### GARRICK'S GIFT

**Read Aloud**:
"He reaches into a hidden floorboard and pulls out a bundle of heavy oilcloth. Inside is a shield. It's marked with the crest of Oakhaven—the Golden Oak—but it has been reinforced with cold-iron strips. 'Take it. If you find the Red Eye... use this to block his gaze. He sees through fear. If you don't show him fear, he can't calculate your death.'"

### QUEST HOOK (Random): METEOR HUNT
**DM**: If Troy (or anyone) asks Garrick for better steel or “the ultimate weapon,” Garrick can say:
"Old stories… star-metal. When the sky throws iron at the earth, it doesn't rust. If you ever see a crater glowing at night—dig before something else does."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: Meteor Hunt
- **Hook**: "The sky bleeds metal. Find the wound before it cools."
- **Objective**: Locate a fresh impact crater and recover star-metal before it’s claimed.
- **Reward (Later)**: Star-metal can be sold for a large bounty or forged into a single finely-made weapon.

### THE CHAPEL

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The chapel doors are open, and the smell of beeswax and incense fights a losing battle against smoke. Candles tremble on the altar from vibrations you can’t quite explain. The stained glass is cracked but unbroken, and the sunrise painted there looks wrong—too pale, like it’s watching you instead of comforting you." 

**Read Aloud**:
"Mother Mathilda is the only one who seems prepared. She is handing out small glass vials of 'Oakhaven Sun-Oil'. 'The woods have been altered,' she warns. 'The trees are no longer just wood and leaf. They are conduits. Every step you take will be felt by the mountain. These oils will mask your thermal signatures. If you want to survive the Hunt, you must become ghosts.'"

### QUEST HOOK (Random): LIBRARY SILENCE
**DM**: If the party asks how to resist the “voices” in the woods, Mathilda adds:
"There are monks—once. A silent library. They said the mind can be armored like the body… if you can endure the quiet."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: Library Silence
- **Hook**: "Shhh. The books are sleeping."
- **Objective**: Seek out the Silent Library and complete its vow trial to harden the mind.
- **Reward (Later)**: Training and blessings that help resist fear and intrusive whispers.

## THE THRESHOLD: NORTH GATE

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The gatehouse has been split like kindling. The iron brackets that once held the beams have been twisted into perfect spirals, as if someone *turned* the metal with their fingers. Beyond the posts, the forest line is too straight, too dark—like someone drew it with ink across the world." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The North Gate is a splintered mess. The massive oak beams have been shattered outward. You stand at the threshold. Beyond, the Whispering Woods loom like a wall of solid shadow. The sun is up, but its light stops at the treeline, as if a physical barrier prevents the morning from entering the forest. 

The 14Hz hum is audible now—a low, rhythmic thumping that makes your teeth ache and your vision vibrate slightly. You look back at Oakhaven, at the smoke and the ghosts of your neighbors. Then you step forward. The moment you cross the line, the sound of the village disappears. You are in the Hunt. You have 180 minutes to find the Iron Lair before the Audit is finalized."

---

# ACT 2: THE WHISPERING HUNT (90 Minutes)

## THE THRESHOLD SHOCK

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"Under the trees, your footsteps don’t sound like footsteps. They sound swallowed. Moss cushions the ground, but it’s threaded with black, glossy roots that look almost like wire. The air is colder here, and damp in a way that doesn’t belong to a living forest—like a cellar that’s been sealed too long." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The moment you step past the North Gate, the world shifts. It isn't just the light; it's the density of the air. It feels like stepping into a cold pool of black oil. The trees here are gargantuan, their trunks scarred with vertical lines that look like barcode markings. The 14Hz thrum vibrates in your teeth, a rhythmic, mechanical pulse that seems to sync with your heartbeats. 

You find the first clue within five minutes: Alice's straw doll. It is lying in a puddle of rain-water that hasn't drained. One button-eye has been removed with a scalpel's precision. There is no blood. No struggle. Just a child's toy, discarded because its 'visual sensors' were no longer required. The trail of the raiders is a straight line of black mud, marching North-North-West. 3.4 miles per hour. They are constant. They are coming."

## THE EYE-KNOTS & THE HUM

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"As you pass between the pale trunks, you notice the knots don’t just *look* like eyes. Some are wet. Some reflect light. And some feel like they’re shifting when you’re not staring at them. A thin film of mist crawls ankle-high, parting around your legs like water around stones." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The oaks give way to a grove of twisted, white-barked trees. Their knots form patterns that look uncannily like human eyes—thousands of them, all fixed on your passage. You feel the temperature drop another five degrees. 

The hum changes frequency here. It becomes a piercing, high-pitched whine that rings in the back of your skull. Roll DC 12 Wisdom Save: On a failure, you hear a voice. A cold, female voice that whispers, 'Specimen [NAME]... pulse elevated. Analyzing adrenal response.' It lasts for a second, then vanishes into the rustling of obsidian leaves."

## THE HUNTER'S CAMP & THE GLASS PRINT

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The clearing feels staged. Not lived-in. The firepit has been rebuilt into a neat ring, but there are no ashes inside it—only a faint gray dust that doesn’t smear like soot. Hanging from a branch is Gale’s hunting charm—bone and twine—cut clean in half. The two pieces sway separately, as if they were never connected." 

**Read Aloud**:
"You reach the clearing where Gale the Hunter usually sets his snares. The site is a nightmare of clinical precision. His tent is still standing, but the interior has been turned into a laboratory. His silver-tipped arrows have been sorted by weight and length on a flat rock. 

In the center of the camp is the footprint. Five feet wide. Deep. The grass inside has been fused into a single, perfectly smooth plate of emerald glass. If you touch it, it's still warm. DC 14 Nature: No creature known to the valley weighs enough or generates the heat required to create this. This was the impact zone of a drop-pod or a massive mechanical leg. High above, the Dire Squirrels watch, their tails twitching in a rhythmic binary. They are the forest's local surveillance network."

### QUEST HOOK (Random): SEE EVERYTHING
**DM**: If the party investigates the camp for clues, they find a strip of marked bark (like a survey grid) and a note written in precise block letters:
"MAP THE ZONE. CONNECT THE EYES."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: See Everything
- **Hook**: "Eyes are everywhere. Connect them."
- **Objective**: Identify and disable (or hijack) the local surveillance network in the woods.
- **Reward (Later)**: A tactical advantage in the woods (safe paths, reduced ambushes, better tracking).

## ENCOUNTER: THE RUSHING RIVER AMBUSH

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The river smells like crushed stone and wet iron. Mist rises in sheets, hiding the far bank in a shifting curtain. The stones you’ll have to cross are slick and too evenly spaced, like someone arranged them for a test. Somewhere in the spray, you hear the click-click of something being cocked back—crossbows, or something worse." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The roar of the Rushing River is a chaotic wall of sound that finally drowns out the 14Hz hum. The water is gray, churning with white foam and debris from the raid. The only way across is a series of precarious stone pillars sticking out of the froth. 

As you reach the midpoint, a violet magnesium flare ignites on the far bank, blinding you for a split second. 'VARIABLE ENCOUNTERED!' a goblin screams from the mist. They rise from the reeds, armored in black scale-mail that doesn't reflect the light. Behind them, a Worg with glowing blue optical lenses let out a roar that sounds like a steam-engine venting. Combat begins."

### COMBAT NOTES
- **Goblins (4)**: Using longbows with 'Tracer Arrows' (Grant +2 to next attack against target)
- **Hulking Worg**: Focuses on 'Tactical Displacement'—knocking players into the river
- **Environmental**: Every 2 rounds, a massive log (10ft long) sweeps through the center stones. DC 12 Dex or be swept 30ft downstream

## THE TOTEM MAZE (THE LOGIC GATE)

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The deeper you go, the less the forest feels natural. Leaves crunch underfoot like thin ceramic. Some branches bend the wrong way, as if pulled by invisible strings. Between two trees you spot a strand of something that looks like spider silk—until it catches the light and you realize it’s a nearly invisible wire, humming softly." 

**Read Aloud**:
"Beyond the river, the forest becomes a dense, claustrophobic labyrinth. The trees are so close together you have to walk sideways. Every few hundred yards, you encounter a Totem. 
1. **The Wolf**: Carved from bone, its eyes glow with a red heat. (The path of Aggression)
2. **The Raven**: Carved from obsidian, its beak is a needle. (The path of Observation)
3. **The Blind Man**: Carved from stone, his eyes are stitched with copper wire. (The path of Submission)

The correct path is marked by the silence. The paths of the Wolf and Raven are loud with the 14Hz hum. The path of the Blind Man is silent. If you follow the hum, you encounter Forest Micro-Events. If you follow the silence, you reach the Iron Lair."

### QUEST HOOK (Random): MEETING THE GUIDE
**DM**: If the party takes a moment to rest here (or if someone fails the earlier Wisdom save), add a brief “cosmic” intrusion:
"For a blink, the totems look… newer. Not carved, but *printed*. A soft aurora flickers between the trees and a figure in plain robes appears where no path exists. He does not step forward—he simply *is* there.

He speaks once, quietly:

'You are being recorded. If you want to live, stop being predictable.'

Then the aurora collapses, and he is gone."

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: The Stranger’s Warning
- **Hook**: "Stop being predictable."
- **Objective**: Keep any proof you find (tokens, pages, markings). Someone out there is watching for those who resist.
- **Reward (Later)**: A contact, a buyer for recovered evidence, or a future job offer.

---

# ACT 3: THE IRON AUDIT (120+ Minutes)

## ENTERING THE LAIR

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The mountain here doesn’t look like it belongs to the same valley. The stone is darker, the pines thinner, and everything is dusted with a fine ash that hasn’t fallen from the sky. The birds won’t come near. Even insects are missing. Your own breathing sounds loud—too loud—like the world is listening for it." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The mouth of the cave is a jagged tear in the side of the mountain, framed by ancient pines. But as you step inside, the natural rock gives way to something impossible. The walls have been smoothed, not by chisels, but by heat, turning the stone into a dull, matte-black obsidian. Violet magnesium flares are spiked into the walls every twenty feet, casting long, flickering shadows that dance like dying ghosts. There is no smell of damp or bat guano here—only the sharp, sterile scent of ozone and the rhythmic *clack-clack-clack* of machinery echoing from deep within."

## THE MAIN DOME (THE RITUAL CHAMBER)

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The dome makes you feel small in a way that isn’t just size. The air is dry and metallic. The blue conduits above pulse like veins, and every pulse makes your skin prickle. The pit beneath Elara’s cage doesn’t just look deep—it feels like it’s *pulling* at you, like gravity is stronger at its mouth." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The tunnel opens into a gargantuan dome, fifty feet across. The ceiling is a web of iron chains and glowing blue conduits that pulse with a slow, heartbeat-like light. In the center of the room, a massive iron winch is groaning, its gears turning with agonizing slowness. And then you see her. Elara is suspended in a rusted iron cage directly over a yawning pit that drops sixty feet into the lightless roar of the subterranean river. Standing at the lever is the figure from your nightmares: a hulking hobgoblin in black plate armor, his single ruby eye burning with a cold, mathematical light."

## RED EYE'S MONOLOGUE

**Read Aloud**:
"The Auditor doesn't even turn his head fully. His ruby eye swivels in its socket, scanning you with a beam of faint red light. 'Variable localized,' he says, his voice like grinding stones. 'Subject [NAME]... Threat Level: Moderate. You are an inefficiency in the calculation. I have 94% of the required data from specimen A-7. Whether she falls now or in five minutes is irrelevant to the Audit. But your termination... that will be a valuable data point in tactical evaluation.'"

## THE WINCH TIMELINE

### T-60 Seconds (Initiative/Start)

**Read Aloud**:
"Red Eye kicks the locking pin out of the winch. The metal screams as the chain begins to slide. Elara's cage jerks downward, the iron bars rattling. 'HELP!' she cries, her voice echoing off the dome. 'IT'S GOING TO DROP!'"

### T-30 Seconds

**Read Aloud**:
"The gears are smoking now. The cage is halfway to the pit's edge. Elara is reaching through the bars, her eyes wide with terror. 'Please! My dad... tell him I'm sorry!'"

### T-5 Seconds

**Read Aloud**:
"The chain is white-hot from the friction. The cage is dangling directly over the black void of the river. One more turn of the gear. Red Eye looks at you, his ruby eye pulsing. 'Data extraction complete,' he mutters. 'Discarding vessel.'"

## COMBAT WITH RED EYE

**DM**: Red Eye is a hobgoblin warlord with enhanced abilities:
- **AC**: 18 (plate armor)
- **HP**: 67
- **Speed**: 30 ft
- **Special**: Ruby Eye can cast *Fear* once per encounter as bonus action
- **Tactics**: Fights clinically, uses the winch mechanism as environmental hazard, tries to push players toward the pit

## RESCUE AND RECOVERY

### ELARA'S RESCUE

**Read Aloud**:
"She collapses into your arms, shaking so violently you can hear her teeth chattering. She smells of soot and ozone. For a long time, she just stares at the black pit where she almost died. 'They... they kept calling me A-7,' she whispers. 'They didn't care about my name. They didn't even care if I died. They just wanted to see what my heart did when it stopped.'"

## THE AUDIT LEDGER

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"The scroll isn’t parchment. It’s something smoother—almost like thin metal—warm at the edges and cold at the center. The letters glow without flame, and when you tilt it, the ink shifts like it’s alive. For a moment, you can *hear* the writing—faint, like a quill scratching bone." 

**Read Aloud**:
"As Red Eye falls, his ruby eye shatters. A scroll of glowing paper unfurls from his armor. It's the Audit Ledger—a complete record of everything taken from Oakhaven:

**SPECIMEN COLLECTION COMPLETE - AREA OAKHAVEN:**
- **Viable Workers**: 47 specimens (including Thomas, Garrick's apprentice)
- **Pioneer Candidates**: 12 specimens (including Elara, designation A-7)
- **Biological Assets**: 23 specimens (children under 12)
- **Data Points**: 1,047 terabytes of physiological and psychological data
- **Asset Liquidation**: 3 structures designated for resource extraction
- **Status**: AUDIT COMPLETE - ZONE SECURED FOR PHASE 2

At the bottom of the scroll, a final entry appears in fresh, glowing text: 'ANOMALY DETECTED. ESCALATION PROTOCOL INITIATED. SUBJECTS [PLAYER NAMES] RECLASSIFIED: THREAT LEVEL OMEGA.'"

### QUEST HOOK (Random): CHESS WITH DEMIURGE
**DM**: If the party studies the ledger for more than a moment, they notice a secondary line — not meant for villagers:
"OBSERVER NOTE: SUBJECTS SHOW PATTERN DEVIATION. RECOMMEND: SOCIAL GAME." 

**DM**: Quest Card
- **Name**: Chess with Demiurge
- **Hook**: "He plays the long game. Last ten moves."
- **Objective**: Survive a future “conversation trial” where your choices matter as much as your blades.
- **Reward (Later)**: Information, leverage, or a negotiated advantage instead of a straight fight.

## THE AUDITOR'S TREASURY (Gold + Decent Gear)

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"Past the winch platform, half-hidden behind a curtain of hanging chain, sits a low iron cabinet bolted into the rock. It has no keyhole—just a recessed handprint and a line of tiny etched runes. When the machinery begins to fail, the cabinet releases with a dull, reluctant *thunk*, like it was never meant to be opened by the living." 

**DM**: Loot Cache (adjust to taste)
- **Coin**: 120 gp, 180 sp
- **Gems**: 3 small garnets (10 gp each)
- **Potions**: 2 potions of healing
- **Weapons (decent, mundane)**: 1 longsword, 1 battleaxe, 1 longbow, 40 arrows
- **Armor (decent, mundane)**: 1 chain shirt, 1 shield, 1 set of studded leather
- **Tools**: a burglar’s kit or set of thieves’ tools (your choice)

## ESCAPE AND AFTERMATH

**Read Aloud (Surroundings)**:
"As you run, the cave’s light turns violent—purple flares strobing like lightning trapped underground. Your shadows jump ahead of you, then lag behind, then split into two for a heartbeat. Somewhere deeper in the mountain, a heavy door slams shut on its own, sealing with a sound like a judge’s gavel." 

**Read Aloud**:
"The iron lair begins to shake. The conduits in the ceiling flare violently, and the machinery shifts into overdrive. Alarms blare—cold, mechanical wails that speak of containment failure and protocol breaches. The Audit may be complete, but your presence has triggered something new. Something worse.

You grab Elara and run. Behind you, the mountain groans as if waking from a long sleep. The 14Hz hum rises to a deafening shriek, then cuts out entirely. In the sudden silence, you hear something else—the distant sound of marching feet. Thousands of them.

You emerge from the cave into twilight. The forest is different now. The eye-knots on the trees are all closed. The hum is gone, but in its place is a feeling of being watched. Of being cataloged. Of being hunted.

As you make your way back to Oakhaven, you find the village changed. The survivors have gathered around the well, where Mother Mathilda is leading them in a desperate prayer. When they see you—when they see Elara—hope flickers in their eyes like the last embers of a dying fire.

But you know the truth. This wasn't just a raid. This was a test. And you've just been upgraded to the next level."
