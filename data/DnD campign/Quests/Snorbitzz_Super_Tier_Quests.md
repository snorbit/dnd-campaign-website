# Snorbitzz's Star-Forged Trials: The Super Tier Arsenal

**"The stars whisper of armaments lost to time. Not World Class, no... but mighty enough to shake the foundations of this realm. If you wish to wield the Arsenal of the Cosmos, you must prove you can endure its weight."**  
— *The Great Snorbitzz*

## Overview
The **Super Tier Arsenal** contains 70 Divine-class items. Snorbitzz does not simply hand these over; he reveals their locations or the specific feats required to manifest them. He calls this the **"Star-Forged Trials."**

**Quest Giver**: The Great Snorbitzz (or his Duplicate)  
**Location**: Can be accessed via Snorbitzz's "Cosmic Observatory" (a pocket dimension) or wherever he appears.  
**Mechanic**: Players request a "Boon of [Type]" (e.g., Blade, Staff, Ring), and Snorbitzz reveals the trial for a specific item suited to their destiny.
