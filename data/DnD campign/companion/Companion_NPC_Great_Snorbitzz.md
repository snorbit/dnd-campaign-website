### Special Traits
***Cosmic Sight.*** Snorbitzz can see through illusions and see the true nature of things. He has advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks and cannot be surprised.

***Ancient Knowledge.*** Snorbitzz has advantage on all Intelligence checks related to history, arcana, or religion. He can recall any information about the ancient world or magical phenomena.

***Time Sense.*** Snorbitzz can sense disturbances in the timeline and knows when time magic is being used within 1 mile of him.

***Magical Resonance.*** When Snorbitzz casts a spell, all allied spellcasters within 30 feet gain advantage on their next spell attack roll or saving throw against spells.

### Actions
***Protective Ward (3/Day).*** As a reaction when an ally Snorbitzz can see is targeted by an attack or spell, he can grant them +4 to their AC and advantage on the saving throw. This protection lasts until the start of Snorbitzz's next turn.

***Reality Bend (1/Day).*** Snorbitzz can alter reality in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point he can see. He can choose one of the following effects:
- Create difficult terrain
- Change the weather
- Create a minor magical effect

### Super Tier Magic
Snorbitzz has access to Super Tier Magic - reality-altering spells that transcend normal magical limitations. He can use each Super Tier spell once per long rest, and casting one requires a full minute of intense concentration and causes visible cosmic phenomena (auroras, stellar alignments, temporal distortions) in a 1-mile radius.

***Fallen Star*** (9th-level Super Tier)
Snorbitzz calls down a meteor of pure cosmic energy that strikes a point he can see within 5 miles. The impact creates a 300-foot radius sphere of devastation, dealing 20d12 radiant damage and 20d12 force damage (DC 35 DEX save for half). All structures in the area are reduced to rubble, and the crater becomes permanently imbued with magical energy.

Snorbitzz stops time for 1 hour (instead of the normal 1 minute). During this time, he can take up to 20 actions and move unlimited distances. He can bring up to 10 willing creatures with him, allowing them to act normally during the stopped time. This spell creates massive temporal ripples that may attract attention from time-traveling entities.

***Reality Rewrite*** (9th-level Super Tier)
Snorbitzz can rewrite a fundamental truth in a 1-mile radius for 24 hours. He can choose one effect:
- Reverse gravity in the area
- Change the weather to any extreme condition

- Alter memories of all creatures in the area (DC 35 WIS save to resist)
- Create a permanent magical terrain feature

Snorbitzz temporarily ascends to a higher plane of existence, becoming a being of pure energy for 10 minutes. In this form:
- He becomes immune to all damage and conditions
- He can cast any spell without using spell slots
- He can see and manipulate events anywhere in the world
- All allies within 1 mile gain regeneration 10 and advantage on all attacks
- Enemies within 1 mile must make DC 35 CHA saves or become frightened for the duration

***Stellar Genesis*** (9th-level Super Tier)
Snorbitzz creates a miniature star that orbits him for 1 hour. The star:
- Emits blinding light in a 500-foot radius
- Deals 10d12 fire damage to any enemy that starts its turn within 100 feet
- Provides healing equal to Snorbitzz's level to all allies within 100 feet at the start of their turns
- Can be detonated as a bonus action to deal 30d12 fire and radiant damage in a 200-foot radius (DC 35 DEX save for half)

***Astral Crown of Eternity***
- **Type**: Headwear (World Class Item)

***Orb of Reality's Heart***
- **Type**: Orb (World Class Item)

- **Daily Power**: Can answer any question with perfect truth about past, present, or future events.

***Ring of Infinite Possibilities***
- **Type**: Ring (World Class Item)
- **Ability**: Grants Snorbitzz the ability to exist in multiple places simultaneously. He can create up to 10 perfect duplicates of himself that share his consciousness and can act independently.
- **Passive**: Cannot be surprised, always acts first in initiative order, can never be disarmed or separated from his possessions

### Legendary Actions
Snorbitzz can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Snorbitzz regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Teleport.*** Snorbitzz magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

## Backstory
The Great Snorbitzz is an ancient being from a plane beyond mortal comprehension, a Snorbian who has existed for millennia. He came to the mortal realm to maintain balance and prevent catastrophic events that could unravel reality itself. 

Snorbitzz has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, the birth and death of stars, and the ebb and flow of magic throughout the ages. His knowledge is vast, but he speaks in riddles and metaphors, believing that true wisdom must be earned rather than given.

He was drawn to the party because he sensed their potential to either save or doom the current timeline. Snorbitzz serves as a guide and protector, offering cryptic advice and powerful assistance when needed, but allowing the party to make their own choices and face their own consequences.

## Personality & Motivations
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Good - believes in freedom and helping others, but follows his own mysterious code
- **Core Motivation**: Preventing the destruction of the timeline and maintaining cosmic balance
- **Philosophy**: "Every choice creates ripples in the stream of time - choose wisely, but choose freely"
- **Likes**: Wisdom, learning, helping worthy causes, observing mortal courage
- **Dislikes**: Unnecessary destruction, tyranny, those who try to control others' destinies
- **Quirks**: Often speaks in metaphors involving stars, time, or cosmic phenomena; forgets mortal customs and social norms

- **Guide**: Pointing them toward important destinations and warning of dangers
- **Observer**: Watching their choices with interest, occasionally offering cryptic advice

## Combat Style
Snorbitzz avoids direct combat when possible, preferring to:
- Support allies with protective wards and enhancements
- Use battlefield control spells to manipulate the environment
- Provide tactical advice through telepathic communication
- Only engage directly when the party is in mortal peril
- Use his reality-bending powers to turn the tide of battle

## Roleplay Guidance
- Speak in a calm, wise manner with occasional cosmic metaphors
- Offer help but don't solve all problems - let the party grow
- Share knowledge when it serves the greater good
- Maintain an air of mystery about your true nature and origins
- Show genuine concern for the party's well-being while respecting their autonomy

## Plot Hooks
### The Ancient Prophecy
Snorbitzz reveals that the party members are mentioned in an ancient prophecy that could determine the fate of the world.

### The Cosmic Threat
A danger from beyond the planes threatens to unravel reality, and only the party, guided by Snorbitzz, can stop it.

### The Lost Knowledge
Snorbitzz seeks forgotten magical knowledge that could help prevent a coming catastrophe, and needs the party's help to retrieve it.

### The Time Disturbance
Strange temporal anomalies appear, and Snorbitzz needs the party's help to investigate and repair them.

## Development Arc
1. **Initial Mysterious Helper**: Appears occasionally to offer cryptic advice and assistance
2. **Growing Trust**: Gradually reveals more about himself and the true nature of the threats
3. **Active Partnership**: Becomes a more regular companion and guide
4. **Personal Investment**: Develops genuine affection for the party and their mission
5. **Ultimate Sacrifice**: May be willing to sacrifice himself to save the party and the timeline

## DM Notes
- Snorbitzz should be used sparingly at first to maintain his mysterious nature
- His powers should be impressive but not so overwhelming that they solve every problem
- Use his cryptic advice to guide players without giving away too much
- Consider having him occasionally fail or be wrong to keep him from seeming omnipotent
- His ancient perspective can provide interesting commentary on mortal affairs
- Use his cosmic knowledge to introduce plot elements and world-building details
