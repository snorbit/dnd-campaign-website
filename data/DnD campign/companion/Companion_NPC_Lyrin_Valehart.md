***Spellcasting.*** Lyrin is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

- Cantrips (at will): *light*, *mage hand*, *prestidigitation*, *minor illusion*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *disguise self*, *mage armor*, *magic missile*
- 2nd level (4 slots): *detect thoughts*, *invisibility*, *mirror image*, *suggestion*
- 3rd level (4 slots): *counterspell*, *fireball*, *fly*, *lightning bolt*
- 4th level (3 slots): *greater invisibility*, *polymorph*, *dimension door*

- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning*, *true seeing*
- 7th level (1 slot): *plane shift*
- 8th level (1 slot): *mind blank*

### Special Traits
***Audit Network.*** Lyrin can send magical reports to Demiurge. Once per day, he can mark a creature; allies gain +2 to hit and damage against the marked creature for 1 minute.

***Infernal Training.*** Lyrin has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by non-Nazarick creatures.

***Nazarick Cipher.*** Lyrin can encode and decode messages using Demiurge's cipher. These messages cannot be deciphered by non-Nazarick creatures.

### Actions
***Multiattack.*** Lyrin makes two attacks with his dagger or casts two spells.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.

***Infernal Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** Lyrin unleashes infernal energy in a 20-foot line or 10-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (8d6 + 4) fire damage plus 22 (4d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Reactions
***Illusory Escape.*** When Lyrin is targeted by an attack, he can impose disadvantage on the attack roll and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see, leaving behind an illusory duplicate of himself for 1 round. The duplicate disappears if it takes any damage.

## Appearance & Manner
- Neat traveling robes; ink-stained fingertips; a leather notebook with interchangeable spines.
- **Voice**: Gentle cadence, steady eye contact. Gives "useful" advice framed as deference.
- **Tics**: Touches the book spine when lying; avoids definitive statements about childhood.

## Backstory (Public)
- Claims apprenticeship to a minor archmage who died in a lab collapse.
- Says he studies coastal ruins to prevent "another disaster" and that the party reminds him of better days.

## True Identity (Secret)
- Covert subordinate of Demiurge. Trained to profile, escalate, and recruit or neutralize high-potential cells.
- Lyrin admires the party sincerely; he records that admiration as risk factors.

## Escalation Timeline
- **Sessions 1–2**: Lyrin "luckily" knows smugglers at the Salt Stair. Provides perfect rope lengths and tide tables.
- **Sessions 3–4**: Vanishes during a skirmish, returns with a key or map the party "would have found anyway."
- **Sessions 6–7**: Contradictory backstory slips. The sigil in his book spine (glimpsed) matches a Nazarick audit mark.
- **Session 10+**: Engineers a parley that reveals the party's price—mercy, gold, survival, or pride.

## Roleplay Guidance
- Compliment competence, not morality. Ask the party questions they want to be asked.
- Offer two right answers—and write down which they choose.
- When cornered, he is apologetic first, pragmatic second, loyal (to orders) last.

## Abilities (5e-Flavored)
### Illusory Escape (Reaction)
Impose disadvantage on an attack and teleport up to 30 ft, leaving an illusory double for 1 round.

### Shadow Arcana (Utility Suite)
- Disguise Self
- Invisibility
- Detect Thoughts
- Silence
- Suggestion

### Infernal Blast (Offense)
8d6 fire + 4d6 necrotic in a 20-ft line or 10-ft burst; DC scales to tier; pushes 5 ft.

### Auditor's Mark (1/day)
As a bonus action, mark a creature; allies gain +2 to hit/damage vs the mark for 1 minute. Each use risks pinging Demiurge's network (complication on 1–2 on a d6).

## Gear & Clues
### Modular Spellbook
Hidden spine compartment with a small tin seal bearing a crescent-horned sigil (Demiurge network key).

### Correspondence
Letters from a "noble patron" whose crest is subtly incorrect—fabricated identity that unravels under scrutiny.

### Ledger
Meticulous party profiles (ideals, bonds, flaws). In cipher; partial decryption reveals his admiration and fear.

## Hooks
### The Restricted Archive
Lyrin trades his letter of introduction for retrieving a null-ink codex from the Ashen Lyceum.

### A Favor for a Friend
Claims a survivor needs extraction from choir zealots—actually a data probe on party priorities.

### The Safe House
Offers a haven on the Broken Crown Road with "friendly" quartermasters (Nazarick-funded Syndicate cell).

## Tension Dials
### Compassion Dial
Lyrin covers for a PC's mistake, paying a personal cost. If helped, his DC to betray rises later.

### Control Dial
He begins predicting the party's choices out loud—unsettling, accurate, and wrong exactly once (on purpose).

### Exposure Dial
NPC witnesses spot his sigil; rumor fallout hits faction meters even if the party defends him.

## Triggered Betrayal (Default)
### Setting
Act V approach to the Black Throne. A failsafe ward protects the party's countermeasure.

### Event
Lyrin disables the ward, calling in infernal reinforcements. He offers a choice: accept terms and live to shape the future, or die "free and unremembered by history."

### If Persuaded
On DC-tiered parley, he flips, offering Demiurge's contingency route at heavy cost (burns a town, saves a kingdom).

## Alternate Resolutions
### Early Reveal & Redemption
The party confronts him by Session 10–12. He admits the audit, becomes double agent. Demiurge escalates tests; Albedo intervenes once.

### Catspaw to Kingmaker
Lyrin ascends as the party's spymaster. The final audit becomes negotiation among equals.

### Burn the Mask
The party ruins his network; Demiurge marks them "untamable." More direct, brutal tests ensue.

## Stat Suggestions (Tier-Agnostic)
- **Defense**: AC suitable to party tier; Evasion-like effect once/short rest via Illusory Escape.
- **Skills**: Insight, Deception, Persuasion, Investigation, Perception; expertise in two.
- **Saves**: Wis/Int; advantage against charm effects from non-Nazarick sources (training).
- **Tactics**: Avoid fair fights. Shape terrain, divide targets, extract assets.

## DM Notes
- Track a private "Admiration Meter" (0–5). Each time the party spares an enemy, pays a personal cost, or shows brilliance, +1. At 4–5, Lyrin hesitates at the betrayal and offers a parley wedge the party can exploit.
- Write down one party principle each session. Lyrin will attack or defend it at the worst possible time—by "helping."
