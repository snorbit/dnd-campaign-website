### Special Traits

***Hidden Power.*** Occasionally, Snorbitzz accidentally reveals glimpses of his true nature:
- When casting spells, sometimes cosmic visual effects appear (faint auroras, star patterns)
- Sometimes knows things he shouldn't (ancient history, future events)
- Occasionally speaks in cosmic metaphors without realizing it
- Has advantage on saves against magic, but doesn't know why

***Faint Cosmic Aura.*** Creatures sensitive to magic can sense something unusual about Snorbitzz, but can't identify what. This aura causes:
- Subtle light distortions around him when he's emotional
- Animals are strangely calm around him
- Plants sometimes grow better in his presence
- Magic items sometimes resonate when he's near

***Danger Sense.*** Snorbitzz has an uncanny ability to sense danger before it happens, giving him advantage on DEX saves against traps and ambushes.

### Actions

***Arcane Bolt.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10 + 2 force damage.

***Protective Charm.*** As a reaction when an ally within 30 feet is targeted by an attack, Snorbitzz can grant them a +2 bonus to their AC. This ability recharges after a short or long rest.

***Mystical Insight.*** Snorbitzz can spend 1 minute concentrating to gain advantage on his next Intelligence (Arcana or History) check. Sometimes this reveals information that seems impossible for a 1st-level wizard to know.

### Legendary Actions (Hidden)
Snorbitzz has access to these abilities but doesn't know it consciously. They may trigger in moments of extreme stress or when the party is in mortal danger:

***Cosmic Echo (1/Day).*** When an ally is about to die, Snorbitzz can instinctively cast a powerful protective spell that seems to come from nowhere (DM's choice of effect, but appears as 1st-level magic).

***Ancient Wisdom (1/Week).*** When faced with an unsolvable puzzle or ancient mystery, Snorbitzz may blurt out the solution without understanding how he knew it.

## Backstory (As Party Knows It)

**The Truth**: The party already knows that this Snorbitzz is a duplicate created by the real Great Snorbitzz. The true Snorbitzz explained:

"I cannot always be with you on your journey, as my presence attracts cosmic attention that could endanger you. So I have created a portion of myself - a duplicate with my knowledge but limited power - to travel with you and guide you. He has my memories and personality, but at a mortal scale. He will grow to care for you as I do, and when the time is right, he will help you find me."

**What the Duplicate Knows**:
- He knows he is a duplicate of the Great Snorbitzz
- He has the original's memories and personality but at mortal power level
- He understands his purpose is to guide and protect the party
- He knows the real Snorbitzz is watching and will appear when the time is right
- He's aware that his existence is temporary and tied to the party's journey

**His Perspective**:
- Feels the weight of being a "lesser version" of his magnificent original
- Sometimes struggles with having cosmic knowledge in a mortal body
- Develops his own personality and relationships despite being a copy
- Knows he must eventually step aside for the true Snorbitzz
- Is determined to fulfill his purpose of helping the party succeed

## Role in Party

**Primary Functions**:
- Guide and mentor with access to Snorbitzz's vast knowledge
- Arcane knowledge specialist with cosmic insights
- Moral compass and voice of wisdom (inherited from original)
- Magical support within 1st-level limitations
- Liaison between the party and the true Snorbitzz

**Relationship Dynamics**:
- Party treats him with respect knowing he's Snorbitzz's chosen representative
- They may sometimes forget his limitations and expect more from him
- He carries the responsibility of being their connection to the true Snorbitzz
- May develop insecurities about being "just a copy"
- His growth and struggles are meaningful to the party who understands his sacrifice

**Growth Potential**:
- As the party levels up, Snorbitzz's hidden powers may manifest more frequently
- His knowledge will grow in ways that surprise even him
- He may develop relationships and attachments that make his eventual "death" more impactful
- His cosmic nature may slowly become more apparent

## The Inevitable End

**The Transformation**: When the party reaches the point where they're ready to meet the true Snorbitzz, the duplicate will sacrifice himself to protect them from a great threat. As he "dies," his form will shimmer and dissolve, revealing the true Great Snorbitzz descending from the cosmos.

**Impact on Party**: The duplicate's death should be emotionally impactful - the party will have grown to care for this humble, kind wizard who gave his life for them, making the revelation of his true nature both shocking and meaningful.

## DM Notes

**Playing the Duplicate**:
- Keep his power level consistently low (1st level)
- Let his hidden knowledge emerge naturally and surprisingly
- Make him endearing and worthy of the party's affection
- Build relationships with each party member
- Drop subtle hints about his true nature throughout the campaign

**Power Manifestations**:
- Save his true power manifestations for critical moments
- Make them seem like accidents or flukes
- Have him be confused and surprised by his own abilities
- Let the party wonder about his true nature

**Character Arc**:
- Start him as simple and humble
- Gradually reveal more depth and hidden knowledge
- Build his relationships with the party
- Make his sacrifice meaningful and earned
- Ensure the party will miss him when he's gone

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "I know what needs to be done, but I lack the power to do it myself. The real me could solve this instantly."
- "Sometimes I forget my limitations and try to do more than I can. Forgive me."
- "The original Snorbitzz is watching over us all. I feel his pride in your progress."
- "It's strange having cosmic knowledge in this mortal form. Like remembering how to fly but being stuck on the ground."
- "When my time comes, I will face it knowing I helped you succeed. That's all that matters."
- "Don't mourn me when I'm gone - the real Snorbitzz will be here soon, and he's magnificent."
