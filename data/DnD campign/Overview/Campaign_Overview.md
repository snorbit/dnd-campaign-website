# Overlord: Ashes of the New World

## Premise
The party awakens in a broken age where the Great Tomb of Nazarick extends its shadow across kingdoms. Whispers claim the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown is not mere conqueror but architect—shaping the world to survive an approaching planar catastrophe. Factions scramble: some beg for protection, others plot rebellion, and a few dream of a future forged by their own hands.

## Themes
- **Power vs Humanity**: What is lost to gain control? What is saved by restraint?
- **Moral Ambiguity**: "Necessary evil" vs "noble failure." Choices stain or sanctify.
- **Masks and Manipulators**: Alliances are tests. Every gift costs. Every rescue is audited.

## Mega-Act Structure (40 sessions)
1. **Act I: The Arrival & Awakening** (Sessions 1-13)  
   Survival, Oakhaven investigation, and first contact with Nazarick's scrutiny. The Salt Stair shipwreck and the discovery of the "Audit" system.
2. **Act II: The Shadows of Nazarick** (Sessions 14-27)  
   Faction courtship, regional power struggles, and the "Broken Crown Road" lattice activation. The party is tested by emissaries and Guardians.
3. **Act III: The Throne's Determination** (Sessions 28-40)  
   The final trials, the Black Throne parley, and the ultimate decision regarding the world's future.

## Core Secrets (DM Eyes Only)
### Nazarick's Strategy
Demiurge orchestrates multi-front "stress tests" to classify threats and candidates for recruitment. The party is a priority case.

### The Catastrophe
A planar convergence draws near. Nazarick aims to monopolize survival protocols and rewrite sovereignty afterward.

### The Companion
Lyrin Valehart is the embedded failsafe: profiler, saboteur, and potential recruiter with genuine affection for the party—weaponized by orders.

### The Crown Road
The "Broken Crown Road" is a ritualized highway that calibrates the lattice. Stopping it saves lives now; leaving it active may save many later—under Nazarick.

## Faction Meter (track 0–5)
- **Nazarick**: Interest, Respect, Reliance, Control, Ownership.
- **Rebels**: Trust, Organization, Reach, Weaponization, Revolution.
- **Choir**: Purity, Zeal, Penetration, Terror, Purge.
- **Neutral Powers**: Diplomacy, Logistics, Coin, Blackmail, Sanction.

## Tone Dials
- **Grim Audit**: Bleak, costs bite, "victory" is compromised stability.
- **Gray Chessboard**: Deal-making dominates; betrayals sting but can be leveraged.
- **Heroic Resistance**: Brighter stakes; more redemptions; harsher final siege.

## Endings (branch by faction meters + Black Throne choices)
- **The Crown Breaks**: Ainz falls; Guardians retreat; the lattice collapses unevenly. Refugees surge; the party becomes lynchpin rulers.
- **Terms of Eternity**: The party accepts Nazarick's terms, wielding authority to harden the world. Stability with iron clauses.
- **Crimson Audit**: Demiurge outmaneuvers all. The party can live—useful, leashed, or mythologized into cautionary legend.
