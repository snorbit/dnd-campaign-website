### Parley Framework (Tokens)
Each side gets 2 tokens per scene:

| **Walk Away** | End parley on your terms |
| **Safe Word** | Pause scene; next check with advantage if concede point |

## Faction Meters (0–5)
Track publicly to unlock/lock options:

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **2 Access** | Audiences, markets, escorts |
| **3 Leverage** | Call in aid, cancel hunts, safe routes |
| **4 Control** | Compel concessions, rewrite minor rules |
| **5 Ownership** | Define outcomes (with strings) |

## Audit Complications
